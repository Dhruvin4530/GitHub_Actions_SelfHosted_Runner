# Create a Self-hosted GitHub Action runner and run a workflow on it.

With GitHub Actions you can use GitHub-hosted runners managed by GitHub to run your workflows but you can also use the self-hosted runners.

Self-hosted runners are those you maintain on your infrastructure that can be on the data center or the cloud.
